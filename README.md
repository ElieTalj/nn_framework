# Write your own neural network framework

This repository contains the code for a simple neural network framework.
In [https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/write-a-neural-network-framework/](this course)
as part of the [https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/](End-to-end Machine Learning School),
we step through this code together, writing it part-by-part in a sequence of
coding exercises.

Come give it a try.

The autoencoder visualization code used here is adapted from another
End-to-End Machine Learning course, [https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/p/neural-network-visualization](Neural Network Visualization).
To understand it down to it's roots, you can walk through that course too.
